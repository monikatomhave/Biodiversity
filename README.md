# Biodiversity
Module 12

The purpose of this project was to help a scientist build a dash board, that includes engaging and dynamic charts and identify the best way to share her information with her audience, which includes her research assistants and her research participants.  Those who participated will be able to visit a website and select their ID number to see which bacterial species live in their navals. 

Using the data from the file provided, there was a bar graph created that shows the top ten bacteria found in each belly button for the participant selected.  Also a bubble chart to display every bateria found for that participant. The size of the bubble reflect the amount found, the larger the bubble, the more found.  Also data was recoded to as to how many times perv week that belly button was washed. So there was also a gauge chart made to display that frequency number.

There were a few enhancments made to the website also.  To give it some flare, there was a colorful picture added to the top.  Underneath that, there was a brief description of the study added and how the samples were collected.  The charts were also enhanced with color in the title and data displayed for a more polished eye appealing look.
