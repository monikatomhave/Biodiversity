                  The microbes inhabiting our 
                  navels and the factors that might influence the microscopic life 
                  calling this protected, moist patch of skin home have been collected 
                  and documented, spurring on even more conversation about the 
                  beneficial roles microbes play in our daily lives.<br><br>Hundreds of 
                  eager navel-gazers participated in the study, donating samples at 
                  in-person events where the volunteers participating in the study 
                  twirled a sterile swab in their belly buttons to collect their microbes.<br><br>
                  There were two things done with the swabs:<br><span class="tab"></span>1.) Each individual’s sample was 
                  plated and let it grow for a couple days, creating a microbial ‘portrait’ unique 
                  to each participant.<br><span class="tab"></span>2.)Basic molecular biology was used to extract and sequence 
                  the DNA from the microbes collected from each belly button. Looking specifically 
                  at the 16S rRNA gene, a gene that’s extremely variable across different strains 
                  of microbes. It provides a molecular “fingerprint” that is being use to distinguish one 
                  species from another. With the help of special software, the microbial sequence data
                  was turned into meaningful results: lists of species (and their relative abundances) 
                  for each belly button.<br><br>Using this data, the basic questions were explored 
                  about the diversity of microbes in belly buttons:<br><span class="tab"></span>What 
                  and how many species live in the belly button?<br><span class="tab"></span>Why are 
                  some species common in many belly buttons and (most) others are rare?<br>
                  <span class="tab"></span>What factors determine the number and kinds of microbes 
                  we see in individual belly buttons?
